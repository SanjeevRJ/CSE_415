# CSE_415
CSE_415 is an artificial intelligence class that I took at UW

###CSE 415: Artificial Intelligence
##Assignment 1
For this assignment we just made a simple chatbot

##Assignment 2
We implemented BFS and A* search in the scope of problems such as towers of hanoi and farmer, fox, chicken, and grain.

##Assignment 3
We made a deterministic (dice roll always yields 1,6) backgammon bot with minimax search. We also implemented a stochastic (any dice roll)
backgammon bot uses expectiminimax search.
